# Beman 
Beman is Android application which allows men to automatically reply messages to their girls.
This app is necessary due to the fact that men are so busy today, so they may forget to send messages to or reply the messages from their girlfriends. This may makes girls misunderstand that their men no longer care for them which significantly contributes to the broker of couples. 
To help gentlemens to focus on their works, but at the same time, keep their relationship strong, our team made this app that can send messages on behalf of its owner. Our goal is to make the girls believe that the messages sent from this app are actuallly the messages sent by __THEIR BOY FRIENDS__. 
This app also has a mechanism to hide itself in the case that the girlfriend of the owner accidentally opens it.
